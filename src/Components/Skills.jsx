        <p className='pt-3'>My Gamified workflow combines strong fundamentals with motion-driven storytelling, where each page transition, component, or micro-interaction is tuned like game feel.</p>

        <p>Interfaces are systems. Motion is feedback.</p>
        <p>If it doesn't feel alive, it's unfinished.</p>
